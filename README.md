# Board Games Rank Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict **rank** of a board game. As a point of reference, data has been gathered from a website [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/), which is:

>"...an online resource and community that aims to be the definitive source for board game and card game content. The site is updated on a real-time basis by its large and still growing user base — more than two million registered users! — making the Geek the largest and most up->to-date place to get gaming information! You can become a registered member of BGG for free, although we welcome your contributions to the site in the form of ratings, reviews, and thoughts on games to the existing database!"

Original dataset contains information about approx. 26k board games. Data has been gathered on Feb 2024.
